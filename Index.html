    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I'm currently practicing my newly acquired web development skills.
        I am a physics engineer living in Mexico. I'm a former math teacher
        but just recently, started working for a tech company.

        <p>Today I started at my new job for Intek Global. I'm very excited for this
            new opportunity since this is the first job that I have at the tech industry.
            I started learning new stuff right away by taking a course in HTML.
